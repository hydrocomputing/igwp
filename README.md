# igwp - Improved Global Warming Potential (IGWP)
> A Global Warming Potential model with improved support for short-lived climate pollutions (SLCPs).


## Why an Improved Version

The Global Warming Potential (GWP) is a commonly used, simple model
to "normalize" the warming impact of different climate pollutants to 
$CO_2$ equivalents. This approach works well for long-lived climate 
pollutions (LLCPs) but fails for short-lived climate pollutions (SLCPs).
The improved version of the GWP accounst much better for effect of
SLCPs.
