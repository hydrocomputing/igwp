# igwp - Improved Global Warming Potential (IGWP)

The Global Warming Potential (GWP) is a commonly used, simple model to "normalize" the warming impact of different climate pollutants to $CO_2$ equivalents. This approach works well for long-lived climate pollutions (LLCPs) but fails for short-lived climate pollutions (SLCPs). The improved version of the GWP accounst much better for effect of SLCPs.
